This is the main thing you need to know. A [Monad](https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad) is a type which has this operation called *bind* ( among others, but we'll keep it simple) defined. Here are the three parts:

1. `m a` - a container of a value of type `a`.
2. `( a -> m b)` - a function that takes an `a` and puts it in the container `m` and potentially converts the type inside the container to a new type `b`, although `a` can equal `b`, so *bind* doesn't have to convert the type inside to another type.
3. `m b` - a new container updated with the value produced by applying *(2)* to the value of type `a` inside *(1)*.
   
Bind is just a way for you to update what's inside a monad. `m` remains constant, but the type which it contains `a` changes to `b`. If we had an operation `op` with a type signature like `op :: m a -> (a -> n b) -> n b`, it would both convert the container type from `m` to `n` as well as the type of what the container contains from `a` to `b`. But don't worry! With *bind* we are leaving the container type constant!

It's important to remind ourselves what we are focusing on here. We are reasoning about the *type* of bind. We aren't thinking about how *bind* actually does what it does in terms of specific operations on the types involved. Programming in Haskell often requires an interchange of reasoning on two levels: 

1. *Reasoning at the type level*: We think in general about the shape of our functions in terms of the types they operate on and what they evaluate to (the last term in the type signature).  
2. *Reasoning at the implementation level*: Eventually we must leave the world of pure reason and actually think about what operations must be performed in order to produce the desired type. 

This is a light weight post, so I'm not going to go into all the rich details needed to fully understand the implications of what I said above, but I would like to at least show you a single case of *bind* in action by using the list monad to create a list filter.

# Application - Filtering a List

```haskell
[34,2,3,14] >>= \x -> if x > 10 then [x] else []
```

When we execute this code, we get: `[34,14]`. Let's look at the terms in this expression.

1. `[34,2,3,14]` - an object of type `[Int]`. Lists are monads, i.e., they provide an definition for bind and the other monad operators, and we can rewrite the type of this object as `[] Int`. So we see that `[]` lines up with `m` and `Int` lines up with `a` in the first argument `m a` of the *bind* operator.
2. `>>=` - the *bind* operator. We know that the left hand side of this operator has the proper type `[] Int ~ m a`, so things are looking good so far, but what about the right hand side *(3)*?
3. `\x -> if x > 10 then [x] else []` - a function which takes an `x` and puts it in the same type of box as the elements of *(1)* -- namely a list. So we know this has the type of `(a -> m b)`, which when we substitute the type variables for concrete types becomes: `Int -> [] Int`. So we have a valid use of the *bind* which, when we substitute the type variables for the particular example we have, has the type: `[] Int -> ( Int -> [] Int ) -> [] Int ~ m a -> ( a -> m b) -> m b`. Let's now review the internals of this lambda function.
    1. `x > 10` - a filter predicate. If it is true we return *(3.2)*, otherwise we return *(3.3)*.
    2. `[x]` - we put our value in the list box when it satisfies our filter predicate *(3.1)*.
    3. `[]` - if our value does not satisfy our filter predicate *(3.1)*, then we return an empty box.


# Exercises
1. How would you use this to create your own `filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]` function?
2. Can `concat :: Foldable t => t [a] -> [a]` and `map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]` be used to create a filter function?
3. Instances of monads also define `return :: Monad m => a -> m a`. How would we use this in place of `[x]` in *(3.2)*?
